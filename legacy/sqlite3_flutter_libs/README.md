# sqlite3_flutter_libs

> [!CAUTION]
> This package relates to version 2.x of `package:sqlite3`, and is obsolete after upgrading.
> Please see [notes on upgrading](https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart/blob/main/UPGRADING_TO_V3.md)
> and remove this package from your dependencies after adopting version 3.x of `package:sqlite3`.

Starting from version `0.6.0`, this package no longer does anything.
Other libraries can depend on version `0.6.0` after migrating to version 3.x of `package:sqlite3` to
ensure that an app does not use the old Flutter-specific SQLite build scripts from `0.5.x` and older.
